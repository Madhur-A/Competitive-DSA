# Competitive-DSA

A collection of programming solutions for various coding problems from different websites, organized by websites and language.

## Repository Structure

* **[Website Name]** (e.g., LeetCode, CodeForces etc.)
    + **[Language]** (e.g., C++, Scala, Java, Erlang etc.)
        - **[Problem Name]** (e.g., Two Sum, Maximum Subarray, etc.)


### LeetCode Solutions in `Scala` and `Erlang`

The majority of `Scala` solutions provided for [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/) problems follow a functional programming approach. However, in cases where functional solutions are impractical or impossible due to problem constraints (e.g., Dynamic Programming, Graph problems), additional non-functional solutions may be provided.
These non-functional solutions, marked with "MLE" (Memory Limit Exceeded) or "TLE" (Time Limit Exceeded) prefixes or suffixes, are typically offered when I have sufficient available time and willingness.
This convention applies to both `Scala` and `Erlang` solutions. While efforts have been made to explicitly label non-functional solutions, occasional oversights may occur.
