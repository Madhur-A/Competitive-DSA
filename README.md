# Competitive-DSA

A collection of programming solutions for various coding problems from different websites, organized by websites and language.

## Repository Structure

* **[Website Name]** (e.g., LeetCode etc.)
	+ **[Language]** (e.g., C++, Scala, Java, Erlang etc.)
		- **[Problem Name]** (e.g., Two Sum, Maximum Subarray, etc.)

## About
For `Scala` and `Erlang`; I've tried my best to provide functional solution (except for `AdventOfCode`, nevertheless, there are times when owing to the nature of the problem or the constraints (Memory Limit or Time Limit) by the respective platforms, pure functional Solutions don't work, in those cases, names of such Solutions have been suffixed with "_MLE/_mle" (for Memory Limit Exceeded) or "_TLE/_tle" for Time Limit Exceeded errors.

Most of the Solutions in `C++` do have a complete reportaire of methods with they could be solved (or with which I've solved them).

## Platforms

* LeetCode

## Languages
