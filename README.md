# Competitive-DSA

A collection of programming solutions for various coding problems from different websites, organized by websites and language.

## Repository Structure

* **[Website Name]** (e.g., LeetCode, CodeForces etc.)
    + **[Language]** (e.g., C++, Scala, Java, Erlang etc.)
        - **[Problem Name]** (e.g., Two Sum, Maximum Subarray, etc.)


### LeetCode Solutions in `Scala` and `Erlang`

Most of the `Scala` solutions for [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/) are functional. However, in situations where it is impossible to provide an accepted functional solution (due to problem constraints or nature, e.g., Dynamic Programming, Graph, and similar), such solutions are marked with "MLE" or "TLE" prefixes or suffixes (in addition to non-functional accepted solutions). The same applies to `Erlang`. Although I've tried to explicitly indicate non-functional solutions in `Scala` and `Erlang`, oversights may occur.


Note:
*   MLE: Memory Limit Exceeded
*   TLE: Time Limit Exceeded
